# PWM-PulseWidth-Modulation
An open-loop speed control system for a DC motor which is controlled by a PWM generated signal.

## Requiements:
  **A.** Generate a PWM signal (freq. = 5000 Hz) with an increasing duty cycle, such that the duty cycle 
         increases from minimum to maximum each 100 ms, show your results on an oscilloscope.<br/>
  **B.** Design a microcontroller-based system to increase the motor speed from zero to maximum
         value along a discrete time interval, i.e. speed increased by 10% every 500 ms.<br/>
  **C.** Design an open-loop control system, which allow a user to vary the motor speed according to
         a knob (Potentiometer).<br/>
  **D.** Allow the user to control the direction and speed of the motor, a knob (Potentiometer) used as follow:
  
        1. When the potentiometer in the middle (50%), the motor is on the idle state (full stop).
        2. As the user moved the potentiometer to the right (>50%), the motor speed increased in
        clock-wise direction.
        3. As the user moved the potentiometer to the lift (<50%), the motor speed increased in
        counter clock-wise direction.
**All used circuits, flowcharts and calculations are provided.**
